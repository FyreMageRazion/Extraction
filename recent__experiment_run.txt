│  concern,\n\nRe: Appeal of Denial for Lumbar Decompression with Instrumented Fusion\n\nExecutive Summary:\nThis letter serves as   │
│  a formal appeal against the denial of coverage for lumbar decompression with instrumented fusion surgery for a 57-year-old male   │
│  diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis with radiculopathy (ICD-10 codes M48.062, M54.16). The denial was based on coverage         │
│  ineligibility, failure to meet medical necessity criteria, and administrative validation issues related to diagnosis, procedure   │
│  codes, and provider credentials. We seek reconsideration based on comprehensive clinical evidence and detailed justification      │
│  supporting medical necessity and compliance with coverage policies.\n\nRebuttal to Denial Reasons:\n1. Coverage Eligibility:\n-   │
│  The denial cited that coverage eligibility could not be determined due to lack of specific CPT or HCPCS codes. We respectfully    │
│  submit that the procedure requested is lumbar decompression with instrumented fusion, which corresponds to commonly recognized    │
│  CPT codes typically used for such procedures (e.g., 22633 for lumbar spinal fusion with decompression). We request coverage       │
│  assessment be completed upon review of these codes.\n\n2. Medical Necessity:\n- The patient has clearly documented lumbar spinal  │
│  stenosis with radiculopathy and has undergone extensive conservative therapy including 12 weeks of physical therapy, 3 spinal     │
│  injections, and a regimen of NSAIDs and neuropathic agents without sufficient symptom relief.\n- Imaging studies (MRI and CT of   │
│  lumbar spine dated 02/2026) confirm the diagnosis consistent with clinical findings.\n- Clinical guidelines and literature        │
│  support surgical intervention when conservative management fails in such cases of lumbar spinal stenosis with                     │
│  radiculopathy.\n\n3. Administrative Validation:\n- Provided diagnosis codes M48.062 and M54.16 are valid and relevant to lumbar   │
│  spinal stenosis with radiculopathy.\n- Provider details, including NPI 1098765432 for Dr. Rebecca Lawson, MD, will be verified    │
│  to ensure compliance with administrative requirements.\n\nSupporting Clinical Evidence:\nPeer-reviewed literature supports the    │
│  effectiveness and necessity of lumbar decompression with instrumented fusion in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis  │
│  refractory to conservative treatments. Published guidelines from spine and orthopedic societies recommend this intervention       │
│  under such clinical scenarios.\n\nRequest:\nWe respectfully request the reconsideration of this denial based on the evidence      │
│  presented, verification of coding and provider credentials, and the established medical necessity of the requested                │
│  procedure.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Authorized Representative/Provider]\n\n---",                      │
