"The report is a good start, but it needs improvement in the following areas:

1.  **Missing context:** The report lacks context about the original dataset and the business problem it addresses. Please add a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the analysis.
2.  **Insufficient interpretation:** While the report includes visualizations, it doesn't adequately interpret their meaning or explain their significance. Please elaborate on the key findings and their implications.
3.  **Lack of recommendations:** The report doesn't offer any actionable recommendations based on the EDA findings. Please include a section with suggestions for further analysis or potential business actions.
4.  **Clarity:** Some sections are unclear and use technical jargon without explanation. Please simplify the language and ensure that the report is accessible to a non-technical audience."

Now, I will instruct the **ReportGeneratorAgent** to revise the report based on this feedback.
